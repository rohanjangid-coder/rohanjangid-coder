ðŸŽ“ I recently graduated with a BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications) degree, equipped with a passion for coding. 
ðŸ’» Throughout my academic journey, I gained practical knowledge in programming language such as Java. I also have knowledge of web development technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
